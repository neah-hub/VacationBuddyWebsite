# Vacation Buddy

This project is a simple web application for an Automatic Plant Watering Device. 
The application consists of multiple HTML files that provide information about the device, live data, and the team behind the project.

## Files

- `green1.html`: The homepage of the application.
- `green2.html`: A page that introduces the team members.
- `green3.html`: A page that will display live data from the device (currently under construction).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on different devices.
- **Navigation**: The navigation menu allows users to easily switch between the homepage, live data page, and team page.
- **Styling**: The application uses custom styles and Google Fonts for a unique look and feel.

## How to Use

1. Open any of the HTML files in a web browser to view the content.
2. Use the navigation menu to switch between different pages.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement live data fetching and display on the `green3.html` page.
- Add more detailed information about the device and its features.
- Improve the overall design and user experience.
